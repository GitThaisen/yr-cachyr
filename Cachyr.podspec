    Cachyr is a small key-value cache written in Swift. It has some nice properties:

    - Written in Swift 3.
    - Thread-safe.
    - Type-safe while still allowing any kind of data to be stored.
    - Disk and memory cache.
    - Data source delegate for easy population of cache when a key is not found.
    - Clean, single-purpose implementation. Does caching and nothing else.
